## About Me
{: #about-me}

I am a MSc student at National University of Singapore, majoring in Computer Engineering (Digitalization and Communication Technology Track).

My research interests lie in cryptography topics, especially in **secure network protocols** and **zero knowledge**. Blockchain and hash signature are interesting to me as well. I am actively looking for research opportunities in these areas, and I am also open to internships in industry labs.
